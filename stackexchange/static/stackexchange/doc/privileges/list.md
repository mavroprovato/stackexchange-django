Returns the earnable privileges on a site.

Privileges define abilities a user can earn (via reputation) on any Stack Exchange site.

While fairly stable, over time they do change. New ones are introduced with new features, and the reputation requirements change as a site matures.

This method returns a list of [`privileges`](#model-Privileges).
